> 🚀 A production-style fraud detection platform for fintech use cases, built with **Python**, **FastAPI**, **machine learning**, **rules engines**, **anomaly detection**, and **MLOps**.

---

## ✨ Vision

FinShield is designed to simulate how **modern fintech fraud detection systems** are built in real-world environments.

Instead of training a single notebook model, this project combines:

- 🧠 **supervised fraud classification** for known fraud patterns
- 🕵️ **anomaly detection** for unknown suspicious behavior
- 📏 **rules-based scoring** for interpretable business logic
- ⚖️ **hybrid scoring** for final risk decisions
- 📡 **FastAPI endpoints** for real-time fraud scoring
- 📊 **monitoring, audit logging, and MLflow tracking** for operational credibility

The goal is to make this repo feel like a **serious portfolio-grade fintech ML system** rather than a simple beginner project.

---

## 🧩 Project Description

Fraud detection in fintech is not solved with one model alone.

Real systems usually combine:

- historical behavior analysis
- merchant and device intelligence
- hand-crafted fraud rules
- probabilistic models
- anomaly scoring
- explainable decisioning
- monitoring and audit trails

FinShield follows that same pattern.

It ingests transaction history, builds fraud features, trains supervised and unsupervised models, evaluates rules, combines all signals into a final score, and exposes the results through a real-time API.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Solves

FinShield helps answer questions like:

- Is this transaction suspicious based on past behavior?
- Does it break known fraud rules?
- Does it look abnormal compared to normal activity?
- Should it be **approved**, **reviewed**, or **blocked**?
- Why did the system make that decision?

## 🧠 Core Fraud Detection Concepts Used

### 📈 1. Feature Engineering
Fraud models are only as good as the features they consume.

This project engineers rich behavioral and contextual features such as:

- ⏰ Transaction time features (hour, weekend, night flags)
- ⚡ Customer transaction velocity (1d, 7d, 30d)
- 💰 Rolling spend behavior
- 📊 Amount deviation from customer history
- 🏪 Merchant historical fraud rate
- 📱 New device indicator
- 🌍 Foreign transaction flag

---

### 📏 2. Rules Engine
Rules provide fast, interpretable fraud logic based on domain knowledge.

Example rules include:

- 💸 High transaction amount
- 📱 New device + large spend
- 🔁 Rapid repeat activity
- 🏪 Merchant fraud hotspot
- 🌍 Foreign high-value transaction

📌 Rules are stored in **YAML configuration** and can be modified without changing code.

---

### 🧠 3. Supervised Learning
The supervised model learns from labeled fraud data and predicts fraud probability.

**Implemented models:**
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- XGBoost (primary classifier)

---

### 🕵️ 4. Anomaly Detection
The anomaly model detects unusual or unseen patterns without relying on labels.

**Implemented model:**
- Isolation Forest

---

### ⚖️ 5. Hybrid Risk Scoring
The final fraud score combines multiple intelligence layers:

- 📏 Rule-based score
- 🧠 Supervised model probability
- 🕵️ Anomaly score

This reflects how real-world fraud systems blend rules and machine learning.

---

### 📡 6. Real-Time Scoring
Transactions are scored in real time using FastAPI endpoints.

- ⚡ Low-latency inference
- 🔄 On-the-fly feature generation
- 🌐 API-based decisioning

---

### 📊 7. Monitoring and Auditability
The platform includes production-style observability features:

- 📈 MLflow experiment tracking
- 🧾 Prediction audit logs
- 📉 Drift report generation
- 📦 Model metadata storage

---
